## Python audio signal processing
Achieve music genre classification and feature extraction. 

### Intro
The power spectrum of the music signal is similar to that of the human brain physiological signal, 
which complies with the 1/f signal formula.
 The alpha value of music signal approaches 1 means 
 music is more pleasant.
 A sound is represented in the form of an audio signal having parameters such as frequency, bandwidth, decibel, etc., 
 and a typical audio signal may be represented as a function of amplitude and time.
